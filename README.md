# @heusalagroup/fi.hg.mysql

Lightweight MySQL persister written in TypeScript.

To use this persister, install following dependencies:

```
npm install --save mysql @types/mysql
```

See also [hgrs](https://github.com/heusalagroup/hgrs).

### It doesn't have many runtime dependencies

This library expects [@heusalagroup/fi.hg.core](https://github.com/heusalagroup/fi.hg.core) to be located 
in the relative path `../core` and only required dependency it has is for [Lodash 
library](https://lodash.com/).

### We don't have traditional releases

This project evolves directly to our git repository in an agile manner.

This git repository contains only the source code for compile time use case. It is meant to be used 
as a git submodule in a NodeJS or webpack project.

Recommended way to initialize your project is like this:

```
mkdir -p src/fi/hg

git submodule add git@github.com:heusalagroup/fi.hg.core.git src/fi/hg/core
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.src/fi/hg/core.branch main

git submodule add git@github.com:heusalagroup/fi.hg.mysql.git src/fi/hg/mysql
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.src/fi/hg/mysql.branch main
```

Other required dependencies are [the Lodash library](https://lodash.com/) and [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql):

```
npm install --save-dev lodash @types/lodash mysql @types/mysql
```
